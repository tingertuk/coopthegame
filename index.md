## The Game of Communal Living!

You can use purchase [Co-op](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/co-op1) directly from The Game Crafter, which will print and send it to you on demand.

Co-op is a non-cooperative game - meaning that there is one winner (or more). The game is designed to simulate different aspects of communal living. It plays with the dynamics of working together to keep the house clean while slacking-off here and there to get some free time and make take a vacation! But do so at your own risk because your ruthless housemates might get back to you and vote some new house rules to make sure you are behaving properly. Another aspect of sharing a living space is getting to know people and making friends. Making friends as an adult can be quite tricky, and living with other people is a great way to have a lot of unstructured, unplanned, fun time. One is always getting to know a little bit more about their housemates throughout their daily interactions, and Co-op aims to do just the same. Co-o is a very social game with a strong get-to-know-you component, making people interact through silly activities or sharing some of their stories and dreams. If want to experience the challenges and glory of living with a bunch of weirdos, take your site at our table and play a round of Co-op.
